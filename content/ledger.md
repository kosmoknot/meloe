   #n Just boarded the train. Will be there at Ahmedabad tomorrow. Seeing the train station after such a long time was an weird experience. It's like I had almost forgotten the feeling of being at the railway station. The stench, homeless, all the poverty.  I do live in a bubble. Reading Norwegian woods. Still at the start so it's interesting but yet to become weird. Maybe this book will not have fishes raining down from sky let's see. Worked from home in an art cafe due to power outage was ok experience I prefer my room. Had an auto driver named shahajahan, mewar wouldn't be happy.

If it was not so hot at Ahmedabad I would have considered it for settling down. One piece keeps getting better.

   #n Ate kaju gulkand barfi, kaju katali, onion kachori, jalebi and ghevar at Jagdish mithai bhandar. It had lot celebrites plastered over walls which I didn't recognise. Drove to Sajjan garh, and sahellion ki bari on bike. Sajjan garh was pleasant drive marked with constant fear of cars silently coming down from behind the turns. Mansoon palace was nothing special, the view was all it had to offer. Coming down from Sajjan garh was a tall task which required lot of braking power. Tried sauf sharbat. Found a plant doing SHM in saheliyon ki bari. That was high point there, rest was under whelming. Went to udaipur palace. Booking tickets with an account which says my name is kosmoknot always leads to fun moments. Palace tickets guy couldn't stop laughing for a while thinking that my actual name was kosmoknot. The palace was extravagant in design but compared to contemporary architecture it seems unrefined. Too many rooms, too narrow corridors and too low roof. Considering how big the palace is it is surprising how claustrophophic it makes you. There were multiple vantage points from where you could see Udaipur's expanse, probably a place for kings to look at all the people they owned. Drank kashmir kahwa, rose hibiscus tea not doing that again. Went to a fancy restaurant and ate dal bati which was better than I had earlier. Only thing in udaipur worth while to look at night is ghat. The worst planned city centre I have ever visited, too narrow for anything. Now I realise why Pondy is so cool, you can just walk around and chill not possible in Udaipur.

   #n Found out that people book sleeper coach for the whole family in a bus. We we were too stupid to book single sleeper seat per person. Finally went to the bagore ki haveli which was next to our hotel all this time. The haveli has 138 rooms, lot of artwork and artifacts, and was owned by a prime minister of mewar at a time. You could stand in one of the balconies or terrace platform and imagine the sense of control and power the prime minister might have felt. One of the painting that stayed with me was of a queen cutting her head to give as a memento to the king. The sheer audacity to cut of head to preserve Rajput pride is something I can't fathom.  Couldn't get a bike shàre thanks to narrow lanes of udaipur but still caught the bus to Jodhpur in time. It is unfortunate that there is no record of people who actually worked on the palaces, sculptures, and artwork rather all the construction is attributed to a single king. It is raining lightly on way to Jodhpur one of the best bus rides. Visited one of the most honest to god roadside dhaba on the way to Jodhpur. Not only they didn't charge any extra money for lack of local competition, I also could open the fridge take out whatever I want and pay for it at the counter. Also a random customer offered me cigs while I was assuming he was a waiter too bad I don't smoke. Spotted my first camel of the Rajasthan trip. Rajasthan's hospitality continues as the auto rickshaw wala verifies my travel plan with a pleasant conversation. Slept on the roof.

 #n Spent half of the day meeting people at Jodhpur. The intergenerational progress is very visible but not sufficient. Women are still not treated fairly. Was chilling throughout the day, missed many city monuments but was still worth it. Museums seem to be great way for kings to dump their excess furniture, crockery, family hair looms while getting free sympathy credits. Ummaid bhavan palace was a hybrid which I didn't really enjoy. The palace has an obviously greeko-roman interior design but captures Mughal architecture on outside. There were paintings of Indian gods in geek and roman styles further identifying with this unique blend of styles. Jodhpur fort was a treat to visit. Compared to this udaipur palace felt a bit underwhelming. Nakshi Patterns were very similar but still slightly different. Jodhpur palace was also emptier which led to a better experience. The exhibits, and rooms inside Jodhpur palace were also grander and more intricate. Couldn't see Jasawant thada as it was closed. Went to mandore garden but couldn't see much as the museum was closed. Had mirchi wada was underwhelming. Kanji sweets is one of the best places to have chat in Jodhpur. For last 2 nights I was living with family of a carpenter who worked for my father. I had spent considerable amount of time hanging out with him while growing up. His grandchildren were visibly surprised to see me spending so much time with their grandpa. Also noone in rajasthan has a high opinion of Rajasthan. Dry land , lack of opportunities, lack of utilities I can't really blame them.

   #n most of the women are covering their face with a cloth. I wonder how does it feels to to have a opaque cloth constantly coloring your vision. Passed by pokharan on the way to Jaisalmer. Sitting in an empty train hurling swaths of dust. Booked a guide since he agreed to drive me around could have avoided that. Was a cool guy but tried really hard to make be buy from local shops. Jaisalmer's lost prestige was visible through the city. Hotel was pretty bad. Visited some local shops and cafes. Shop selling mango lassi was good.

   #n Found a cheaper safari. Paying guide saved me 1/2 of amount on safari booking so a worthwhile trade in the end. Would recommend Jaisalmer Haveli for stay. Taking a bike into dessert should be fun. Bike ride was actually fun. Google maps took me to bad location inside desert but luckily I was able to trace back my path. Stopped at the Kuldhara abandoned village, which was slightly ominous but nothing special. Tried to click some selfies with decent results. Went to Sam desert place from there and my solo trip got even more solo as I was given jeep and camel safari alone. Could have saved lot of money if I had someone to share it with. But you can't put price on solitude. Lot of people were asking for charity and 2 girls actually swindled me by not giving the change back. Didn't want to start a fight so considered it a small donation. Camel wala was lamenting on not having technical skills to advertise his camel rides directly to people like me, thinking of possible solutions. Also saw the power of increamental pricing one you pay for resort, resort people convince you to go on a jeep ride, once there they convince you to go on a parachute jump then on something else. Went to the sunset point on camel back and it reminded me of the park I used to play in as a child which had a small section covered in sand. Even the shrubs around thar looked liked savana to me. It's slightly amusing that I have seen savana more times on TV than Thar. There was a folk dance performance with horrible coordination between 2 dancers who were missing all the beats but created a nice ambiance. Food was sub-par but hotel wala dude was focused on getting good ratings out of me. Drive back was slightly hard with incoming cars blinding me each time they passed. Really need to get some goggles and a tiny backpack. Hotel owner was equally obsessed with ratings and roamed around with me around jaisalmer at night showing me stuff. Shared his ambition of expansion and having the rooftop restaurant perform better. Slept while watching OG vs QC, OG lost game 1. Damn just checked the results OG had actually won, I guess my memory is really unreliable.
